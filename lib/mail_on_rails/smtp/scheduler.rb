    # Minimal Fiber::Scheduler (pure Ruby, IO.select-based) that lets one
    # worker thread serve many SMTP sessions concurrently: each session runs
    # in a fiber, and any blocking IO (socket reads, TLS handshakes, DNS,
    # store HTTP calls), sleep, or Queue wait parks the fiber instead of the
    # thread. One scheduler per worker; nothing here is shared across
    # workers, so Ractor isolation holds.
    #
    # Implements the required hooks (fiber, io_wait, kernel_sleep, block,
    # unblock, fiber_interrupt, close) plus timeout_after. unblock is the
    # only cross-thread entry point - it is how another thread's Queue#push
    # wakes a fiber parked in Queue#pop - so it only touches the
    # mutex-guarded ready list and the wake pipe.
    #
    # IO#timeout note: Ruby does not pass an io's own timeout into io_wait
    # (it arrives as nil), so a scheduler that ignores it would silently
    # disable the sessions' idle timeout. io_wait therefore honors
    # io.timeout itself, raising IO::TimeoutError into the waiting fiber -
    # the same error the non-scheduler IO path raises.
    #
    # Usage (see Worker): set as the scheduler on a fresh thread, start the
    # root fiber with Fiber.schedule, then call #close explicitly - it runs
    # the event loop until no fiber is waiting on anything, and re-raises a
    # fatal session error as the caller's own (so it becomes the worker's
    # visible outcome rather than swallowed thread-exit cleanup).
    class Scheduler
      # One armed timer. action :wake resumes the fiber with :timeout (the
      # io_wait/block "timed out" signal); an exception class action is
