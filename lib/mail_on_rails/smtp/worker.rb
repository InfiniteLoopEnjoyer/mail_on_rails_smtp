    # Serves many SMTP sessions on one thread: a dispatcher fiber takes
    # incoming connections and starts a session fiber per connection, all
    # multiplexed by Scheduler. Implicit-TLS handshakes happen here too, so
    # the accept loop never blocks on a slow handshake.
    #
    # Two intake modes, one Worker:
    #
    #   Ractor mode (Worker.spawn_ractor): one Worker per core, each inside
    #   its own Ractor for true parallelism. Sockets cross the boundary as
    #   raw fd numbers over a control pipe ("<fd> <spec index>\n" lines) and
    #   are re-wrapped with TCPSocket.for_fd - fds are process-global, and
    #   integers avoid Ractor IO moves entirely (moved IOs misbehave under a
    #   fiber scheduler on Ruby 4.0.6; see scheduler.rb). The worker builds
    #   its own store and TLS context inside the Ractor - neither can be
    #   shared across the boundary - and reports each finished session by
    #   writing a byte to the shared release pipe, which the accept side
    #   turns into ConnLimiter releases.
    #
    #   Thread mode (Worker#serve_queue): same serving core on a plain
    #   thread, fed [socket, spec] pairs through a Thread::Queue and sharing
    #   the caller's store/limiter directly. Used when a store instance is
    #   injected (tests, embedded development) - an in-process store can't
    #   be rebuilt inside a Ractor.
